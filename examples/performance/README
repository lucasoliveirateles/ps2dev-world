This sample is here to show the effect that different rendering parameters,
particularly the lighting model, have on performance.  ps2gl has a number of
renderers that sit on vu1 and do transform, lighting, clipping, etc. to geometry
streamed in from main memory.  There is one set of basic renderers (split based
on primitive type) that can handle all of the possible rendering states in
ps2gl.  These renderers can be thought of as the "default" renderers.  There are
also a few specialized renderers that are much faster than the default ones,
because they have been written specially for a very limited set of conditions.

Try adjusting the different parameters to see the effect they have on rendering
time.

Timing
------

The timing information displayed here is not very accurate; in addition to being
off by a constant factor of a few percent, per-frame overhead plays affects the
results pretty heavily because of the small number of polys.  The performance
numbers are only intended to be used for comparing the different rendering
contexts/primitives.
