             RenderWare Graphics Example (PlayStation 2): Imagetex
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE 

The IMAGETEX example illustrates the correlation between different image
types and the textures that are generated from them. It also shows how
the texture's raster type can vary across different platforms.

The example consists of a series of different images which reflect all 
the typical types of image that may be used. In most cases the PNG image 
format has been used.

The following describes the formats of the images that have been used:

    img888.png    -  24-bits (8 bits per component).
    img8888.png   -  32-bits (8 bits per component).
    imggray.png   -   8-bits (Gray-scale).

    imgpal4.png   -  Image with a 4-bit palette.
    imgpal8.png   -  Image with an 8-bit palette.

    imgpal1.bmp + imgpal1m.bmp  
                  -  Shows how two palletized images can be used to 
                     create a masked texture.

    imgpal2m.png  -  Shows how a single image can be used to create a 
                     masked texture.

    imgmask.png + imgmaskm.png
                  -  Shows how two 32-bit images can be used to 
                     create a masked 32-bit texture.

    imgdffsz.png  -  Show how an image with dimensions that aren't
                     a power of two is loaded.

There are many factors to be aware of with respect to image and texture
formats:

(A) Although RenderWare fully supports the PNG image format, certain 
    formats undergo conversion at read time before they are converted 
    into textures. An example of this would be grayscale images which 
    are converted to RGB images at read time on some platforms.

(B) Different platforms have different methods for creating textures. 
    The PC platform generally creates texture rasters of a default depth 
    regardless of the image format. This often means that palletized 
    images are converted to non-palletized textures.

(C) Masked images are always converted to 32-bit rasters, regardless of 
    the image format. To create masked images with different formats the 
    image should be pre-processed outside of RenderWare and should be 
    read as a single image with no mask, e.g. imgpal2m.png.

GENERAL CONTROLS

SELECT button           - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

START + SELECT          - Quit the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

LOAD IMAGE           - Allows the user to select an image.

FPS                  - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                       second being rendered (updated every second).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN        - Select menu item.

DPAD LEFT and RIGHT     - Modify menu item value or execute associated 
                          command.

LEFT ANALOG stick       - Modify floating point value (if applicable) 
                          otherwise do what you would do in general 
                          controls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELP CONTROLS

DPAD UP and DOWN         - Scroll a line at a time (autorepeat available).

LEFT SHOULDER #1 and #2  - Scroll a page at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIDEO MODE SELECTION

The command-line option '-vms' can be used to enable a simple video 
selection screen, which appears before the application starts running. 
Use the UP and DOWN DPAD buttons to highlight the required video
mode and press START to make the selection. Note there are several pages
of video modes; use the LEFT SHOULDER buttons to move from page to page.
